If the vehicle is driven with the key stuck in the “start” position, and the vehicle’s interior temperature cools or the vehicle experiences a significant jarring event, the ignition lock cylinder could move out of the “start” position, rotate past the “run” position, and move into the “accessory” position.","If the key moves into the “accessory” position, engine power, power steering, and power braking will be affected, increasing the risk of a crash. In the event of a crash, the timing of the key movement into the “accessory” position relative to the activation of the sensing algorithm of the crash event may result in the airbags not deploying, increasing the potential for occupant injury in certain types of crashes.","Dealers will inspect steering columns for identifying information (date code and/or production cavity number) and replace if necessary, the ignition lock housing, free of charge.",

If a wheel-speed sensor fails in these vehicles, a software error in the vehicle’s electronic-brake control module (EBCM) can cause the vehicle’s driveline-protection system to activate when (i) the vehicle’s electronic transfer case is set to four-wheel drive or automatic mode, and (ii) the vehicle is driven between the speeds of 41 and 60 MPH. If the driveline-protection system activates, the driver will experience unintended braking on the wheel on the opposite side of the failed sensor.","If a wheel-speed sensor fails, the vehicle’s Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) malfunction indicator warning lamps will illuminate and the vehicle’s driver information center will display a “Service StabiliTrak” message. If these vehicles are driven in this condition while in four-wheel drive or automatic mode at 41-60 MPH, unintended braking on one wheel can occur, causing the vehicle to pull to one side, increasing the risk of a crash. Owners can eliminate this risk by operating the vehicle in two-wheel-drive mode until the recall repair is performed.",Dealers will reprogram the electronic brake control module (EBCM).,

1G1YB3D4XM5108364,no,Airbag Light May Not Indicate Malfunction,complete,21V421,2021-06-03,"General Motors has decided that a defect which relates to motor vehicle safety exists in certain 2021 model year Buick Envision vehicles; Cadillac CT4, CT5, Escalade, and Escalade ESV vehicles; Chevrolet Corvette, Suburban, and Tahoe vehicles; and GMC Yukon and Yukon XL vehicles. A software problem exists in certain of these vehicles which would cause a sensing diagnostic module (SDM) communications fault to illuminate the airbag malfunction indicator lamp, but only on alternating ignition cycles. As a result, an SDM communications fault would not consistently illuminate the airbag light on every ignition cycle to indicate a problem to the driver.","A driver might not be warned of an SDM loss of communication fault which might indicate a problem with airbag deployment. If airbags do not deploy appropriately in a crash, there is an increased risk of injury in that crash.","GM will update the software in the vehicles� serial data gateway module. Owners who have accepted applicable terms and conditions will have the opportunity to accept these software changes using wireless over-the-air (OTA) technology without having to bring their vehicle to a dealership. Alternatively, owners may schedule to have the updates performed at a GM dealer.",

The affected wheel could tilt outward and create a dragging action that would tend to slow the vehicle and create a tendency for the vehicle to turn in the direction of the affected wheel. In extreme situations, the affected wheel assembly could separate from the vehicle. Separation of the wheel assembly would also sever that wheels hydraulic brake hose and result in diminished braking performance of the vehicle, which could result in a crash.","Dealers will inspect the ball stud joints and measure the torque of the nut for all front lower control arms in all models affected as well as the rear lower control arms on the XLR and Corvette. If the torque is not at specification, the dealers will replace the ball stud, the knuckle, and the nut free of charge. If the torque is at specification, the dealers will replace the nut/washer assembly only free of charge.",

If a ball joint were to separate, one or both of the windshield wipers could become inoperative, which could limit the driver’s visibility under certain operating conditions which may increase the risk of a crash causing injury and/or damage to property.

2GNFLNE30D6260467,no,Front Wiper Transmission Corrosion Failure (Canada Vehicles Only),complete,,,"""Certain 2010-2017 model year Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain vehicles located in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland/Labrador may experience high wiper module transmission ball joint corrosion and/or wear which could result in the separation of one or more ball joints from its corresponding socket during operation. If a ball joint were to separate, one or both of the windshield wipers could become inoperative, which could limit the driver’s visibility under certain operating conditions which may increase the risk of a crash causing injury and/or damage to property. The predominant failure mode is water draining through the Air Inlet Panel (AIP) onto the wiper transmission ball joints, leading to grease washout of the link ball sockets. As the grease washes out of the transmission ball joint sockets, contaminants are able to enter the joints causing corrosion and wear of the link ball and socket, resulting in a reduced retention force of the joint. """,TBD,"Dealers will replace the front wiper module with a new module with improved ball joints and a water deflector. In addition, dealers will fill the water management hole near the passenger side wiper pivot and drill a small hole on the adjacent wall of AIP to direct water away from the wiper transmission joints.",
